# NSREPowershell
Powershell Repository

Very much a work in progress

Currently the troubleshooting functions should work with minimal code updates (variable values, etc)

The functions in SQLBasics require a database to be set up with the same tables, values, etc of the one that I have been testing on. I'm still working out how I can approach that part but that will be later on.

For any questions, comments, or concerns, please email me at noobishsre@gmail.com
